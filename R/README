File: MissedGenes

What is it: These are genes that are not present in the gene-exon database (which is derived from the UCSC Table Browser output for all RefSeq genes (coding only, excluded predicted genes ("XM"))

File: <prefix>_AllInts_wGenes.bed

What is it: This file should contain all the original bed intervals and an extra column that contains the genes' whose exon overlaps with it.  There will be lots of intervals with no genes assigned if a list of genes is supplied are an argument, since it will only look for overlaps with those genes.

File: <prefix>_GenesWoIntervals.txt

What is it: Only created if gene names are given in the bed file provided. This file lists all the genes that were in the provided gene list that did not fall on one of the intervals in the provided bed files. This has nothing to do with mapping genes to intervals.

File: <prefix>_GivenGenesOnly.bed

What is it: This file is <prefix>_AllInts_wGenes.bed but only keeps the intervals which have provided gene names (in the bed file) that are also in the provided gene list.

File: <prefix>_ExonIntervals.bed

What is it: This file contains all the exonic intervals for the genes in geneLocs, which was created from the UCSC Table Browser using RefSeq data. It can be loaded into IGV to see the regions that were interogated.
